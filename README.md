## Introduction

In this project, we will:

1. Read in a dataset of dog images.
2. Train a convolutional neural network (CNN) to classify them by breed.
3. Optimize the model for better performance.

By the end of this project, you'll understand how to use Keras to train and optimize a neural network and how to work with images using Python.

## Code

You can find the code for this project in the repository. The main file is:

- [`classifier.ipynb`](./classifier.ipynb) - A Jupyter notebook that loads the images and trains a neural network.

## Local Setup

### Installation

To follow this project, please install the following locally:

- **[JupyterLab](https://jupyterlab.readthedocs.io/en/stable/getting_started/installation.html)**
- **[Python 3.8+](https://www.python.org/downloads/)**

#### Python Packages

You can install the required Python packages using `pip`:

```bash
pip install tensorflow Pillow pandas matplotlib
GPU Support
You will also need to have a GPU on your machine and configured. To set things up, you'll need to install GPU support for TensorFlow. You can follow the instructions here to set up GPU support.

If you encounter issues or don't have a GPU, please use Google Colaboratory. Colaboratory provides a Jupyter notebook environment in the cloud with full GPU support.

Data
You'll need to download the dog image dataset to follow this project:

dog_images.zip - Please unzip this file into a folder called images.
The dataset is originally from Stanford. The original dataset has many more breeds included, which you can use to extend your analysis.

Usage
Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/yourusername/your-repo-name.git
cd your-repo-name
Install the required Python packages:

pip install tensorflow Pillow pandas matplotlib
Run JupyterLab:

jupyter lab
Open classifier.ipynb and follow the instructions to train your model.

Troubleshooting
If you encounter any issues, please refer to the official TensorFlow and Keras documentation or seek help on Stack Overflow.
